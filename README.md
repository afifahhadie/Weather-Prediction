# Weather Prediction Project

## Description
This project aims to analyze weather data using Python. The weather data includes information such as date, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. The project leverages various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the weather dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive and static charts to understand weather patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze weather trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named `weather.csv`, which contains the following information:
- **date**: Date of the weather record.
- **precipitation**: Precipitation (mm).
- **temp_max**: Maximum temperature (°C).
- **temp_min**: Minimum temperature (°C).
- **wind**: Wind speed (m/s).
- **weather**: Weather condition (e.g., rain, sunny, fog).

The dataset consists of 1461 rows and 6 columns.
